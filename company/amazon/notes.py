Pending


1. Binary Serialize Deserialize - Check iterative approach
2. Matrix Median - Solve using binary search
3. Max Distance - Implement O(n) approach
4. Sorted Array to BST - Try iterative version
5. kth smallest element - What if BST is modified
6. Valid BST - Check for iterative approach
7. Single number 2 - Check complicated bit approach
8. Random pointer deep copy - Check O(1) and single pass approach
9. Atoi - Check solution with direct string converstion to integer, currently converted to integer directly. 
10. Reverse words - O(1) space complexity


Interesting

1. Count 1bits -> hamming approach/ pattern/ lsb
2. Generate paranthese -> Time complexity of catalan2. Generate paranthese -> Time complexity of catalan
3. Compare version -> to remove leading zeros, convert string to number
4. Reverse words -> How to implement O(1) reversal without using lists?
